# Talk_with-Images_using_Gen_ai_vision

Gemini Vision Application
This repository contains a Streamlit application that integrates with the Google Gemini Vision model to analyze and generate content based on user input and uploaded images. The application leverages the capabilities of the Gemini Vision model to provide detailed responses about images, either with or without an accompanying textual prompt.

Features
User Input Prompt: Users can enter a textual prompt to guide the model's analysis.
Image Upload: Users can upload an image in JPG, PNG, or JPEG format.
Image Display: The uploaded image is displayed within the app.
Content Generation: The application uses the Google Gemini Vision model to generate a detailed response about the uploaded image, optionally influenced by the user's input prompt.
How It Works
Environment Setup:

The application uses dotenv to load environment variables from a .env file, ensuring that sensitive information such as API keys is securely managed.
python
Copy code
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()  # Loading all the environment variables
Streamlit Initialization:

The application is initialized with Streamlit, setting the page title and header.
python
Copy code
import streamlit as st
st.set_page_config(page_title="Vision model")
st.header("Gemini Vision application")
Google Gemini Vision Model Configuration:

The Google Gemini Vision model is configured using the API key loaded from the environment variables.
python
Copy code
import google.generativeai as genai
genai.configure(api_key=os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"))
Model Interaction:

A function get_generate_output is defined to interact with the Gemini Vision model. It takes user input and an image, and generates a response.
python
Copy code
def get_generate_output(input, image):
    if input != "":
        response = model.generate_content([input, image])
    else:
        response = model.generate_content(image)
    return response.text
User Interaction:

The application provides an input field for the user to enter a prompt and a file uploader to upload an image.
python
Copy code
input = st.text_input("Input Prompt: ", key="input")
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose an image ...", type=["jpg", "png", "jpeg"])
Image Display:

If an image is uploaded, it is displayed within the application.
python
Copy code
if uploaded_file is not None:
    image = Image.open(uploaded_file)
    st.image(image, caption="Uploaded Image", use_column_width=True)
Content Generation and Display:

When the "Tell me about the image" button is clicked, the application generates a response using the Gemini Vision model and displays it.
python
Copy code
submit = st.button("Tell me about the image ..")
if submit:
    response = get_generate_output(input, image)
    st.subheader("The response is")
    st.write(response)
